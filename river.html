                    <p>The Lower Shenandoah, approaching Harper's Ferry, features beautiful Class I and II rapids surrounded by the lush scenery of the Blue Ridge Mountains. This section is known for its crystal-clear waters that reflect the surrounding greenery, creating a serene atmosphere that contrasts with the more intense Potomac.</p>
                    <p>Our Shenandoah trips highlight the river's unique ecology, with opportunities to spot bald eagles, herons, and other wildlife that thrive along its banks. The river passes through historic farmlands and forests before dramatically meeting the Potomac at the point that Thomas Jefferson once described as "worth a voyage across the Atlantic" for its beauty.</p>
